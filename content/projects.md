#### Built ML Pipeline in ServicNow using Deep Learning & AzureML
- Developed and deployed an LSTM time series model with 87% accuracy to forecast supply chain incidents.
- Enabled proactive escalation strategies, resulting in reduced operational costs and improved response times.
- Built and maintained data pipelines using Python, SQL, and Azure for model training and deployment.
- Integrated insights into Power BI dashboards used by senior leadership for decision-making.
- Collaborated cross-functionally with analysts and ops teams to align model outputs with business needs

#### Predicting 3 Pointer Accuracy for NBA Players
- Scraped 10 years’ worth of NBA shooting statistics and Implemented data pre-processing and feature engineering such as
standardization and one-hot encoding to reduce potential for overfitting
- Employed regression, classification and ensemble methods through bagging models such as Random Forest on features to predict
3 point percentage. Selected best hyperparameters by finetuning the number of learners and nodes per decision tree
- Employed neural net using Adams optimizer through TensorFlow to reduce the loss function mean squared error of the regression
model by 18% and misclassification rate by 12%
- Finalized that best contributors to a better three point percentage were the players’ Free Throw percentage and offensive rating based on models developed

#### MITRE Corporation: Robustness and Resiliency of National Supply Chain (Pharmaceuticals)
- Analyzed the national Freight Transportation within the United States of both imported and exported products such as pharmaceuticals and chemical products to pinpoint potential weak routes
- Implemented both python packages such as networkx and Tableau to visualize the supply chain network for different modes of transport such as air, water and trucks while using kilotons of import as edge thickness
- Implemented Spectral Clustering to analyze stable clusters of states and visualize inter node interactions
- Computed Resiliency scores for each state using PCA and capacity scoring based on transport infrastructure viability and accidents

#### Life Insurance Risk Prediction
The goal of our project is to help insurers predict the level of risk (high/low) associated with a prospective client seeking to purchase a life insurance plan. We have built predictive models for binary classification using Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting. We found the test accuracy for Logistic Regression to be 65.7%, 68.3% for the KNN model, 68.6% for Decision Trees and 72% for the random forest model.
