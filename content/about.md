Hey everyone, welcome to my website. My name is Trevor Idayaa Kevin Xavier and I was born in Dubai on March 27th 1998. I did my undergrad in Aerospace Engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University with a concentration in Aeronautics. I completed my Masters in Operations Research at Cornell University on May 2022. I'm a data analyst and scientist with 3+ years of experience turning complex datasets into clear, actionable strategies. My work spans logistics, aviation, and consulting, where I’ve built predictive models, automated analytics pipelines, and delivered business intelligence solutions that drive impact. I specialize in Python, SQL, and Power BI, and I’m passionate about solving real-world problems with data.

This website provides access to my resume and past projects that I have worked on. Take a gander and enjoy !!
